are expected to be strings. The function should return the string Fizz if
the combined length of the parameters is divisible by 3, the string Buzz
if it is divisible by 5, and the string FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3.

is a minor, a youth, or an elder. Anyone below 18 years is a minor,
anyone between 18 and 36 years is a youth, and the rest are elders

6. Write a function named twoSum that takes two parameters: nums and
target. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return
the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and
you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

[Solved in index6 and script6]

7. Given an Array containing integers, floats, and one-character strings,
write a function that takes an Array as a parameter and returns an
Object with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is an array
of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd
numbers, and chars is a list of sorted single-character strings.

[Not Solved check index7 and script7]

8. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least
twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct

[Solved in index8 and script8]

9. Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears
twice except for one. Find that single one
